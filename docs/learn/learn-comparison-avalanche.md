Polkadot and Avalance both have an architecture which allows for application specific blockchains to be designed and connected via a "main" chain. In Polkadot this is the Relay-chain and Avalance does this with 3 primary chains, the P-chain, X-chain, and C-chain. Similar to how Polkadot has its Parachains that connect to the Relay-chain, Avalanche has what're called subnets. Subnets are application specific chains that can be deployed along side the primary chains.

## Architecture

As formentioned, the Avalanche architecture is comprised of three different chains. With this model, the seperations of concerns targets the main platform, exchange, and contracts. 

#### P-chain (Platform)

The P-chain is responsible for the validator set and securing the network

#### X-chain (Exchange)

#### C-chain (Contracts)
